--- Example with constant fuel consumption ---
Number of crab positions: 10
Need to take positions into account from 0 to 16
- Fuel needed for position 0: 49
- Fuel needed for position 1: 41
- Fuel needed for position 2: 37
- Fuel needed for position 3: 39
- Fuel needed for position 4: 41
- Fuel needed for position 5: 45
- Fuel needed for position 6: 49
- Fuel needed for position 7: 53
- Fuel needed for position 8: 59
- Fuel needed for position 9: 65
- Fuel needed for position 10: 71
- Fuel needed for position 11: 77
- Fuel needed for position 12: 83
- Fuel needed for position 13: 89
- Fuel needed for position 14: 95
- Fuel needed for position 15: 103
- Fuel needed for position 16: 111
Best position: 2 -> fuel needed: 37
Position  1 -> fuel needed:  41
Position  3 -> fuel needed:  39
Position 10 -> fuel needed:  71

--- Aufgabe 1: Constant fuel per distance ---
Number of crab positions: 1000
Need to take positions into account from 0 to 1910
*** Best position: 313 -> needs fuel: 335271 ***

--- Example with linearly increasing fuel consumption ---
Number of crab positions: 10
Need to take positions into account from 0 to 16
- Fuel needed for position 0: 290
- Fuel needed for position 1: 242
- Fuel needed for position 2: 206
- Fuel needed for position 3: 183
- Fuel needed for position 4: 170
- Fuel needed for position 5: 168
- Fuel needed for position 6: 176
- Fuel needed for position 7: 194
- Fuel needed for position 8: 223
- Fuel needed for position 9: 262
- Fuel needed for position 10: 311
- Fuel needed for position 11: 370
- Fuel needed for position 12: 439
- Fuel needed for position 13: 518
- Fuel needed for position 14: 607
- Fuel needed for position 15: 707
- Fuel needed for position 16: 817
Best position: 5 -> fuel needed: 168
Position  2 -> fuel needed:  206

--- Aufgabe 2: Fuel consumption increases with distance ---
- Best position for constant fuel consumption: 313 -> now needs fuel: 106883588
Number of crab positions: 1000
Need to take positions into account from 0 to 1910
*** Best position: 461 -> needs fuel: 95851339 ***
