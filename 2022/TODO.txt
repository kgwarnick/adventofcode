2022 Day 15  More efficient implementation (currently 1min runtime)
2022 Day 16  Cleanup of recursive function, make path reporting work
2022 Day 22  Simplify edge transitions:
             Instead of calculating which edge is applicable to a certain
             position (complicated testing in EnterEdge(), WrapAroundEdge()),
             set up a "teleport-from-edge-to-edge" array mapping
	       (exitx, exity, exitfacing) -> (enterx, entery, enterfacing)
	     by looping through edges once like in DrawMap() .
	     This array can be set up for both in-line/in-column wrap-around
	     and cube-like wrap-around, so the same movement functions
	     could be used afterwards.
